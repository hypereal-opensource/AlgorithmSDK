# Irrlicht-math
Math library of Irrlicht Engine.

This library exported [Irrlicht Engine](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/)'s math libraries, e.g. quaternion, vector and matrix.

And changed some types to align with personal style.

The copyright of original code belongs to `Irrlicht Engine`'s author, Nikolaus Gebhardt.

Thanks to Nikolaus Gebhardt, giving us such a wonderful tool!
